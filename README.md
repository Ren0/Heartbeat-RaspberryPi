Heartbeat-RaspberryPi
=====================

Scheduled Python script that helps manage a farm of RasperryPi machines. 
We have a few RaspberryPi machines deployed in different places around the world.
We schedule the Python script to run on each RaspberryPi in order to manage them from our main server.
Works with Python 2.7.3 (installed by default in most Linux distributions for RaspberryPi)
